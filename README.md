# PWC_Diversity_Inclusion

## Objective
The objective of this data analysis project is to provide actionable insights that will enable the Human Resources department to improve gender balance at the executive management level. This analysis will focus on identifying existing challenges, uncovering trends, and highlighting opportunities to enhance diversity and inclusion within the organization. Specifically, the goals are to:
- **Evaluate Current Gender Distribution:** Analyze the gender composition across all levels of the organization, with a particular focus on executive management, to identify any imbalances.
- **Identify Barriers to Progress:** Investigate potential obstacles preventing gender parity, such as biases in hiring, promotion processes, or organizational culture.
-

### Requested KPIs
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech
support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges
and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Data Source
The data is given by Pwc Switzerland.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel:** For initial data exploration and preparation.
- **Power BI:** To transform data, create interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Process Overview
### 1. Get the Data
- The dataset is obtained from the Pwc Switzerland.

### 2. Explore the Data in Excel, in this stage, the data is being explored, and after closely examining the dataset, the following points were observed:
- **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify necessary columns for analysis.
- After exploring the data, it is found that the data is already cleaned but need to change some column name, change data type and need to add one extra column using M code in Power Queru Editor. These changes will be done in Power BI.

### 3. Visualize the data in Power BI

Before creating visualizations, we need to transform the data in the Power Query Editor as well as need to add one extra column:

1. **Transform Data**:
- In this stage, we have changed the columns name and corrected their data type.
- Extra column "Tenure_In_Years" is created in Power Query Editor.

### Visualizations
Now coming on to Visualizations, we have used:
Cards, Donut Chart, Pie Chart, Stacked Bar Chart & Stacked Column Chart

#### 1. Cards

The card shows all the number of services Churned customers has signed for, number of tech and admin tickets are opened by Churned customers.

#### 2. Donut Chart

This chart shows the number of lost customers using different internet services and the subscription type they were having.

#### 3. Pie Chart

This chart shows the no of lost customers on the basis of their Gender. And in another Pie chart, it shows the proportion of paperless billing of lost customers.

#### 4. Stacked Bar Chart

It shows the tenure of lost customers, how long the customer had joined us.

#### 5. Stacked Column Chart

This chart shows the lost customers using different payment method.
